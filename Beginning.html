<h1 style=font-color:red padding="250px">  Tuberculosis (TB) </h1>
<img src="2.jpg" alt="tuberculosis" style="width:600px;height:300px;padding:100px"><br>

<p> <b>Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) that most often affect the lungs. Tuberculosis is curable and preventable.TB is spread from person to person through the air. When people with lung TB cough, sneeze or spit, they propel the TB germs into the air. A person needs to inhale only a few of these germs to become infected.

About one-quarter of the world's population has latent TB, which means people have been infected by TB bacteria but are not (yet) ill with the sease and cannot transmit the disease.
People infected with TB bacteria have a 5–15% lifetime risk of falling ill with TB. Persons with compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV, malnutrition or diabetes, or people who use tobacco, have a higher risk of falling ill.</p>

<p>When a person develops active TB disease, the symptoms (such as cough, fever, night sweats, or weight loss) may be mild for many months. This can lead to delays in seeking care, and results in transmission of the bacteria to others. People with active TB can infect 5–15 other people through close contact over the course of a year.</b></p> 


 <p> Without proper treatment, 45% of HIV-negative people with TB on average and nearly all HIV-positive people with TB will die.</p>

<h2>   Symptoms of Tuberculosis:   </h2>

<p>The most common symptom of Tuberculosis is lasting for more than 3 weeks. Other symptoms include - </p>
<details>
  <summary>    Fatigue   </summary> 
<img src="fatigue.jpg" alt="Fatigue" style="width:300px;height:300px;padding:50px"><br>
<p> Fatigue can cause a vast range of other physical, mental and emotional symptoms including: chronic tiredness or sleepiness, headache, dizziness.
Fatigue is a term used to describe an overall feeling of tiredness or lack of energy. It isn’t the same as simply feeling drowsy or sleepy. When you’re fatigued, you have no motivation and no energy. </p>
</details>


<details>
  <summary>    Coughing up blood  </summary> 
  <img src="cough.jpg" alt="Coughing up blood " style="width:300px;height:300px;padding:50px"><br>
  <p> Coughing up blood can be alarming, but isn't usually a sign of a serious problem if you're young and otherwise healthy. It's more a cause for concern in older people, particularly those who smoke.
The medical term for coughing up blood is haemoptysis.
You may cough up small amounts of bright red blood, or frothy blood-streaked sputum (phlegm). The blood is usually from your lungs and is often the result of prolonged coughing or a chest infection</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>  Fever </summary>
<img src="fever.jpg" alt="Fever" style="width:300px;height:300px;padding:50px"><br>
<p>In response to an infection, illness, or some other cause, the hypothalamus may reset the body to a higher temperature. Although the most common causes of fever are common infections such as colds and gastroenteritis, other causes include: Infections of the ear, lung, skin, throat, bladder, or kidney.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>  Chills  </summary>
<img src="chills.jpg" alt="Chills" style="width:300px;height:300px;padding:50px"><br>
<p>Chills are feelings of coldness accompanied by shivering. They may arise with or without fever. Without fever, chills typically arise after exposure to a cold environment. Essentially any condition that may produce fever (including infections and cancers) can result in chills along with fever. Fever and chills are common symptoms of influenza infection (the flu). Exposure to a cold environment can result in chills. With prolonged or constant exposure to cold, serious injuries related to hypothermia (a lowered core body temperature) can result. </p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>  Night sweats </summary>
<img src="night.jpg" alt="Night sweats" style="width:300px;height:300px;padding:50px"><br>
<p>Doctors often hear their patients complain of night sweats. Night sweats refer to excess sweating during the night. But if your bedroom is unusually hot or you are wearing too many bedclothes, you may sweat during sleep, and this is normal. True night sweats are severe hot flashes occurring at night that can drench your clothes and sheets and that are not related to an overheated environment.</p>

<h2>  Causes of Tuberculosis </h2>
<p> Tuberculosis can be caused because of: </p>

<details>
<summary>  Weakened immune system  </summary>
<img src="low.jpg" alt="Weakened immune system" style="width:300px;height:300px;padding:50px"><br>
<p> Your immune system can also be weakened by smoking, alcohol, and poor nutrition. AIDS. HIV, which causes AIDS, is an acquired viral infection that destroys important white blood cells and weakens the immune system. People with HIV/AIDS can become seriously ill with infections that most people can fight off.</p>

<details>
<summary>  Saliva droplets spreading from person to person when the infected person coughs or sneezes </summary>
<img src="snee.jpg" alt="saliva dropletts spread" style="width:300px;height:300px;padding:50px"><br>
<p>TB is spread from person to person through the air. When people with lung TB cough, sneeze or spit, they propel the TB germs into the air. A person needs to inhale only a few of these germs to become infected.Tuberculosis is caused by bacteria that spread from person to person through microscopic droplets released into the air. This can happen when someone with the untreated, active form of tuberculosis coughs, speaks, sneezes, spits, laughs or sings.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary> Friends and family of the infected person </summary>
<img src="failne.jpg" alt="Friends and family of the infected person" style="width:300px;height:300px;padding:50px"><br>
<p>If you or your family members have lung TB which can be spread to others, the close ones like family members, friends or schoolmates are asked to come to the health centre. They are examined to see if any of them has TB or if someone has become infected with TB.</p>

<h2> Preventive Measures and Diets for Tuberculosis </h2>
<p> Tuberculosis can be prevented by following the given preventive measures: </p>

<details>
<summary>  Avoid close contact with people where infected may be seen for instance hospitals </summary>
<img src="12.jpg" alt="hospitals" style="width:300px;height:300px;padding:50px"><br>
<p>The amount of time needed for home isolation is different for each person. Your health care provider will let you know how long you need to stay at home. Tests of your sputum will help your health care provider know when your home isolation can stop. If you take your medication, your TB will get better. Once tests show you are no longer contagious, you will be able to do the same things you did before you became sick.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary> Vaccinations if you are infected so that it does not spread </summary>
<img src="vacc.jpg" alt="vacine" style="width:300px;height:300px;padding:50px"><br>
<p>Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is a vaccine for tuberculosis (TB) disease. This vaccine is not widely used in the United States, but it is often given to infants and small children in other countries where TB is common. BCG does not always protect people from getting TB.</p>
</details>

<br>

<h3 style="padding:50px">Foods for tuberculosis are banana, peanut, cereal porridge, wheat and ragi, mango, orange, sweet pumpkin carrots, amla, guava, tomato, nuts and seeds, whole grain cereals, seeds, nuts, fish and chicken.</h3>

<h1 style="font-color:red;">  Malignant and Other Tumours </h1>
<img src="tum.jpg" alt="tumors" style="width:600px;height:300px;padding:100px"><br>

<p>  <b>Malignant tumours are cancerous and develop when cells grow without any control. It can grow to other parts of the body and spread as well making it life-threatening.
A tumor is an abnormal growth of body tissue. Tumors can be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign).In general, tumors occur when cells divide and grow excessively in the body. Normally, the body controls cell growth and division. New cells are created to replace older ones or to perform new functions. Cells that are damaged or no longer needed die to make room for healthy replacements.

If the balance of cell growth and death is disturbed, a tumor may form. The person may feel a tumour while often it is detected via imaging tests like MRI. Let us read about the symptoms, causes, and ways to prevent it below- </b></p>

<h2>  Symptoms of Malignant and Other Tumours  </h2>

<details>  
<summary> In the early stages, malignant tumours usually don’t show any symptoms. The first symptom is usually a painless lump. </summary>

<img src="ump.jpg" alt="lump" style="width:300px;height:300px;padding:50px"><br>

<p> If the lump has solid components, due to tissue rather than liquid or air, it could be either benign or malignant. However, the only way to confirm whether a cyst or tumor is cancerous is to have it biopsied by your doctor. This involves surgically removing some or all of the lump.</p>
</details>

<h2> Causes of Malignant and Other Tumours </h2>
<p>   Causes of malignant and other tumours include:  </p>

<details> 
<summary> Ionising radiation </summary>
<img src="r.jpg" alt="ionising radiation" style="width:300px;height:300px;padding:50px"><br>
<p>There are reasons why people are concerned that cell phones (also known as “mobile” or “wireless” telephones) might have the potential to cause certain types of cancer or other health problems:

Cell phones emit radiofrequency radiation (radio waves), a form of non-ionizing radiation, from their antennas. Parts of the body nearest to the antenna can absorb this energy.
The number of cell phone users has increased rapidly. There were over 400 million cell phone subscribers in the United States in 2017, according to the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet AssociationExit Disclaimer. Globally, there are more than 5 billion cell phone usersExit Disclaimer. </p>
</details>


<details> 
<summary> Genetics </summary>
<img src="genetics.jpg" alt="Genetics" style="width:300px;height:300px;padding:50px"><br>
<p>Cancer is a genetic disease—that is, cancer is caused by certain changes to genes that control the way our cells function, especially how they grow and divide.

Genes carry the instructions to make proteins, which do much of the work in our cells. Certain gene changes can cause cells to evade normal growth controls and become cancer. For example, some cancer-causing gene changes increase production of a protein that makes cells grow. Others result in the production of a misshapen, and therefore nonfunctional, form of a protein that normally repairs cellular damage.</p>
</details>

<details> 
<summary> Pathogen </summary>
<img src="pathogen.jpg" alt="Pathogen" style="width:300px;height:300px;padding:50px"><br>
<p> infectious agents play an aetiologic role in approximately 20% of cancer cases worldwide. At least, more than ten pathogens, including viruses, parasites, and bacteria are known to contribute to oncogenesis either directly via the expression of their protein products or indirectly via chronic inflammation.Bacteria are very small living things that are made up of only one cell. Most types of bacteria aren’t harmful, but some can infect people and cause diseases. A few have even been linked with cancer.</p>

<h2> Preventive Measures of Malignant and Other Tumours  </h2>

<p>Preventive measures of malignant and other tumours are-  </p>

<details>
<summary> Quit tobacco </summary>
<img src="na.jpg" alt="quit tobacco" style="width:300px;height:300px;padding:50px"><br>
<p>If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with cancer, quitting tobacco use is one of the best ways to improve the chances of successful cancer treatment. Some people believe that it is too late to quit after a cancer diagnosis, that the damage has already been done.</p>
</details>


<details>
<summary> Eat healthy food  </summary> 
<img src="he.jpg" alt="food" style="width:300px;height:300px;padding:50px"><br>
<p>Eating vegetables containing carotenoids, such as carrots, Brussels sprouts, and squash, may reduce the risk of lung, mouth, pharynx, and larynx cancers. Diets high in non-starchy vegetables, such as broccoli, spinach, and beans, may help protect against stomach and esophageal cancer</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Get regular immunisation  </summary>
<img src="MMUNE.jpg" alt="immune strong" style="width:300px;height:300px;padding:50px"><br>
<p> Antigens are substances on the surface of cells that are not normally part of the body. The immune system attacks the antigens, usually getting rid of them. This leaves the immune system with a “memory” that helps it respond to those antigens in the future.

Cancer treatment vaccines boost the immune system's ability to recognize and destroy antigens. Often, cancer cells have certain molecules called cancer-specific antigens on their surface that healthy cells do not have.</p>
</details>

<details> 
<summary> Maintain a healthy body weight </summary>
<img src="EIGHT.jpg" alt="mentain weight" style="width:300px;height:300px;padding:50px"><br>
<p>You can lower your risk of cancer by enjoying a healthy diet, being physically active every day and maintaining a healthy body weight. Studies show being overweight, physically inactive and not eating well increases your risk of developing cancer.</p>
</details>

<br>
<br>

<h3 style="padding:50px">The symptoms and diets may vary from patient to patient. It is advisable to consult a doctor if you are having these symptoms. 

Although the life-threatening diseases that we just talked about can be prevented and treated, in case the supplies are not readily available or if the response is not quick, these may even cause deaths. 

As the risk is high, we should not compromise on the precautionary measures as well, of which buying critical illness coverage is one. Having a comprehensive health insurance plan assures you good quality treatment in the time of emergency.</h3>
